11,NAKANISHI Natsuyuki,General Catalogue of Males,1963,"This 12-meter-long artwork made of several sheets of cyanotype paper is a life-size back photography of Hi-Red Center (hereinafter HRC) members: Natsuyuki Nakanishi， Genpei Akasegawa， and Tatsu Izumi. The photographs were taken during the ""Shelter Plan"" by HRC， an event which took place on 26 and 27 January 1964 in the old building of the Imperial Hotel. The aim of the event was to measure and record the bodies of guests and sell their life-size ""shelters"". The artwork landed at Keio University in connection to the Hijikata Tatsumi Archive (in Keio University Art Center). For the exhibition ""Tatsumi Hijikata + Natsuyuki Nakanishi–– Back"" (in 2012， Keio University Art Center)， a restoration of the work was planned. The artwork， composed of some sheets of paper， was severely damaged by the past displays. There is a slip of paper on the back of it with the names of the artists involved， indicating that the artwork had been repaired after every exhibition. In order to preserve the original texture of the artwork and its documentary value， the appearance had been kept as is. Before the exhibition， the tape traces were removed， and the damaged parts and joints of the connected papers were restored with washi paper and shofu-nori (wheat starch paste) to withstand installation. After the exhibition， a new storage box made of acid-free paper was prepared for long-term preservation.",images/works/11.jpg,audio/en/11_en.mp3,https://objecthub.keio.ac.jp/object/6192
12,NOGUCHI Isamu and TANIGUCHI Yoshiro,The Ex-Noguchi Room [A common room in the Second Faculty Building],1951 (partially relocated in 2005),"The “Noguchi Room” was a common room on the first floor of the Second Faculty Building on Mita Campus created in 1951， designed through a collaboration between the sculptor lsamu Noguchi (1904-88) and the architect Yoshiro Taniguchi (1904-79). The Second Faculty Building was dismantled for the construction of the South Building in 2003， and was partially relocated to the roof terrace on the third-floor of the South Building in a different form. The ""Ex-Noguchi Room"" underwent a major restoration in 2007， when the stool and other furniture were loaned to the Isamu Noguchi Foundation and the Garden Museum in New York. Research conducted during the restoration revealed that the materials used by Noguchi， which were commonly used in Japan in the 1950s， are now hard to find. So， the materials matching the original were sought. In addition， it was confirmed that the furniture was deteriorating due to direct sunlight from the relocation to the roof terrace. Therefore， furniture covers were made to protect them from sunlight. Also， UV-blocking film was affixed to the window. These countermeasures slow down deterioration， and are very effective for preserving the works. Since then， the furniture has been under continuous care， with experts inspecting its condition once a year， cleaning it， and applying protective wax. At present， the Ex-Noguchi Room is usually closed to the public， but it is periodically opened to the public and users are given guidelines on how to use it. We are striving to inherit architectural spaces while maintaining a balance between preservation and utilization.",images/works/12.jpg,audio/en/12_en.mp3,https://objecthub.keio.ac.jp/object/6397
13,NISHIWAKI Junzaburo,Untitled,,Junzaburo Nishiwaki was a poet and English literature scholar who was active in the Taisho and Showa periods. As a child he had aspirations to become a painter， and even after he gave up on being a professional， he often continued to make paintings. In recent years， many of these works have been exhibited and presented， but Nishiwaki continued to make paintings not as a painter， but as an amateur; many of his works， such as portraits of acquaintances， were made in a casual manner. On the canvas used as a support for this work， which is usually used for oil paintings， he painted with a very quick brushstroke touch. In addition to the heads and bodies of human figures， there are also some animals and plants. By the time of the donation of this work， most of the layers of paint had cracked and fallen away， probably due to the fact that the water-based paint used had failed to adhere to the base. Thus， it was difficult to store the work in the collection in its original state and immediate restoration was considered. Because of the extent of the peeled areas， priority was given to maintaining the painting in its original state， and the fragile layers of paint were not filled in or painted over， but rather the adherence was strengthened. The spalled surface still  remains painfully visible today.,images/works/13.jpg,audio/en/13_en.mp3,https://objecthub.keio.ac.jp/object/6193
14,OKUMA Ujihiro and SUZUKI Chokichi,Miniature Lighthouse， Gifted in Celebration of Fukuzawa Yukichi's 60th Birthday,1897,"This miniature lighthouse was donated and produced to celebrate Yukichi Fukuzawa's 60th birthday. The sculptor Ujihiro Okuma， a leading person of Western-style sculpture in the Meiji era， made the mold for this work. Its casting was done by Chokichi Suzuki， the metalworker who inherited metal casting techniques from the Edo period. This work’s significance lies in its unique expression of the Meiji era， where Western techniques were comined with traditional Japanese ones. The body of the lighthouse has a five-layered pattern made from two different types of alloy. The rough waters in the lower part are silver， crashing against elaborate rocks of copper. These indicate Okuma's mastery of dynamic expression and Suzuki's exquisite craftsmanship. Although the work had remained damaged for a long time， its restoration started to prepare for the exhibition ""Fukuzawa Yukichi: Living the Future"" (2009， Tokyo National Museum and others).  Each process was carefully followed through with the help of its blueprint and photographic documentation (printed materials from the Meiji era) attached to the work. With exhibition in mind， the basic policy of the conservation was to reconstruct the appearance of the missing and deformed metal parts without seeking to match the original materials. The parts were reconstructed with reference to accompanying documents， using materials easy to obtain and work with such as brass and polyester resin. Its mechanical parts were unrepaired， their colors left in the state of metal oxidation due to aging.",images/works/14.jpg,audio/en/14_en.mp3,https://objecthub.keio.ac.jp/object/6177
15,WADA Kaheiji,Bust Figure of Fukuzawa Yukichi,1932,This is a plaster model for the Bust Figure of Fukuzawa Yukichi that was placed in the Fukuzawa Yukichi former residence in Nakatsu City， Oita Prefecture. The bronze statue was lost due to the government’s metal contribution during World War II; only the plaster model remains and conveys its original appearance. This particular plaster statue was displayed in the cafeteria of the Keio rowing club's training camp. Plaster being a fragile material， the statue had been damaged in many places over the years， including the nose， ears， and protruding sleeves， and had been temporarily glued together with unknown material and transparent tape. For the conservation， the old repair marks were removed and the original shape was restored with appropriate plaster. Using the silicone mold taken from the restored plaster statue， another statue consisted of fiberglass-reinforced-plastics was installed in the training camp in its place. During the conservation procedure of the plaster statue body， its bottom part was flattened and stabilized. Ensuing final shape correction and supplementary coloring， it was stored in the warehouse on Mita campus. The bronze statue in the Fukuzawa Yukichi former residence was rebuilt after the war by Kaheiji Wada， and the plaster model of the new statue is also in the Keio University collection， thanks to a donation from his family. Wada， who created the statue of Fukuzawa twice， was a sculptor who graduated from Tokyo University of the Arts in 1908 and was active before and after World War II， but not only Wada's works but also many other bronze statues of the same period were lost in the war. Therefore， the preservation of the plaster model has an important value in the history of modern Japanese sculpture.,images/works/15.jpg,audio/en/15_en.mp3,https://objecthub.keio.ac.jp/object/6336
16,HASEGAWA Eisaku,Injo,1917,"This sculpture was awarded Special Top Prize at the 11th Bunten exhibition in 1917. In the same year， Eisaku Hasegawa withdrew from the Japan Sculpture Society and established a woodcarving organization， the Sendan-sha. He was inspired by the Yakushi Nyorai statue at Shinyakushi-ji Temple in Nara， and pursued a deep spirituality through the wood carving technique of ancient Japan to attain a new approach to expressing nude women. The title ""Injo"" is a Buddhist word meaning the way Buddha takes people by the hands to save them. The palm facing the viewers looks like a mudra， evoking several characteristics of Buddha statues. On the other hand， it is presumed that there had been some the application of white color serves as a way to differentiate expression of female nudity from Buddhist statues. In 2008， a conservation treatment， in which several white residues along with the difference in color tone of the hair and the pedestal were carefully observed， was carried out. After a detailed investigation， by carefully and repeatedly correcting the brightness， the texture of the wood carving was restored. The little finger of the left hand was also missing， but fortunately its fingertip was carefully preserved and repaired during the conservation. This work was donated along with the Fujiyama Memorial Hiyoshi Library (present Fujiyama Memorial Hall， which became the memorial hall with the construction of the new Hiyoshi Library in 1985)， and is assumed to have been in the library until the new library was built in Hiyoshi. It had been stored in the warehouse of the new library， but was restored when it was transferred to Mita Campus.",images/works/16.jpg,audio/en/16_en.mp3,https://objecthub.keio.ac.jp/object/5953
17,KONO Michisei,Ashinoko Lake Scene，Hakone,,"Michisei Kono was known for his detailed oil painting style and for the many illustrations he produced in his later years. He was a member of the Sodosha led by Ryusei Kishida， and was appointed teachers of the art department at Keio Gijuku Yochisha elementary school along with his fellow Sodosha member Hitoshi Seimiya  in 1923 by Kishida's recommendation. In 1927， Kono was replaced by Sadao Tsubaki， and this work was donated to the Yochisha as a memorial of his teaching career.  The exact dates of production and donation are unknown， but the stylistic features suggest that it was produced in the late Showa period. When the painting was restored in 2005， it was found to have numerous cracks in the painting， and the coloured layer on the trees had fallen off. The report also stated that the frames used to protect the work were weak， that the hanging brackets and strings were not strong enough， and that the glass had mold. Due to such predicament， it was decided that the restoration would consist of ""minimal symptomatic measures""， such as the removal of dirt as well as the application of anti-seizure and fillers to the damaged areas， along with replacement of the frame and the improvement and reinforcement of the fixation of the work to the frame.",images/works/17.jpg,audio/en/17_en.mp3,https://objecthub.keio.ac.jp/object/6223
18,SUDA Hisashi,Ducks,1947,"Hisashi Suda's early works were characterized by oil paintings with distinct essence of Academism. However， after the end of the war he absorbed the Cubist styles of Picasso and transformed himself into an artist with an entirely different style. This work was accepted for exhibition in the third annual Nitten in 1947， and was donated by the artist to KeioGijuku in 1948. From 1949 to 1952， Suda was a teacher of art techniques at Keio Junior High School. The restoration report of 1999 showed that the painting had not been adequately protected and that dust and mites had stained the painting， affecting its colour. It also reported that the paint layer was fragile and in a ""very dangerous condition"" due to ageing. As a result， there was a decision to clean the painting， keep it from flaking， reinforce and reattach the painting cloth， and improve the framing. After the restoration， the colour tone of the painting was improved and the rippling of the cloth was reduced. Spacers were also added to the frame to strengthen the work's hold. Today， the work is still hanging in the Keio Junior High School.",images/works/18.jpg,audio/en/18_en.mp3,https://objecthub.keio.ac.jp/object/5981
19,INOUE Kozo,Flower: Grand Swing,,Kozo Inoue moved to France after graduating from Keio University in 1960. After studying at the Académie de la Grande Chaumière， he worked mainly in Paris. Inoue's style is characterized by the concise form and delicate shading of the motifs. Starting with silkscreen prints， he left behind many works in the field of environmental art， including murals and designs. This work was a wall decoration for the Fujiyama Memorial Library. The work is a five-piece set， but when it was removed after the library was relocated， it was divided into two and three pieces and stored separately. Some of them went missing for a while， but were found later. All pieces were damaged， and some of the canvases were stained with graffiti because the lower part of the work was at an accessible height. Therefore， the five pieces were repaired together. As it was difficult to remove the graffiti written in pencil， watercolor was used to make up for it. Damaged parts of the support were repaired with flax fiber. The number of colors in this work is small， and the expression of shading in the repeated motifs is slightly different in each of the five paintings. In addition， since the five paintings had been soiled to various degrees， the conservator had to carefully adjusted the complementary colors， requiring a great deal of time for restoration.,images/works/19.jpg,audio/en/19_en.mp3,https://objecthub.keio.ac.jp/object/6081
20,OYAMA Enrico Isamu,Keio Shiki Senior High School Mural,2003,"This artwork was created by Enrico Isamu Oyama， a contemporary artist who developed his own motif ""Quick Turn Structure"" (hereinafter QTS) when he graduated from Keio Shiki Senior High School. This is one of the artworks which marks his starting point as an artist. He has had a strong interest in writing culture since his high school days， and this work developing as an abstract form， although it remains somewhat literal， serves as an allusion of QTS’ cultivation. Painted on the school's block wall， this work stood in a particular area of the schoolyard for many years. However， due to deterioration of the concrete wall by the aging， it had to be replaced; followed by the Keio Shiki Senior High School’s proposal to enact a preservation project of the work. In 2019， field surveys were carried out by conservators of sculptures because the supporting medium is a three-dimensional block wall and by conservators of paintings because of the aerosol painting. Based on their reports， several people， including the teachers and staff at the Keio Shiki Senior High School， department staff of the building construction in Keio University， internal art experts， external conservators， and the artist himself， have been discussing the conservation policy of the artwork. This project could be considered a challenge to conserve contemporary art from the perspectives of preserving street art， artworks as a part of buildings， and artworks in the education field.",images/works/20.jpg,audio/en/20_en.mp3,https://objecthub.keio.ac.jp/object/6394
39,KITAMURA Shikai,The Maiden Tekona,ca. 1909,"This sculpture was awarded Special Top Prize at the 11th Bunten exhibition in 1917. In the same year，Eisaku Hasegawa withdrew from the Japan Sculpture Society and established a woodcarving organization，the Sendan-sha.

51,USAMI Keiji,Eventually They All Come into a Circle No. 1,1982,Similar to <i>Flora of Knowledge</i> by IIDA Yoshikuni， this work by USAMI Keiji had been installed in the New Building of Keio University Library in 1982 on the right side of the entrance hall. Its entirety is now difficult to grasp due to the placement of automated doors. Nonetheless， the oblong canvas which fills up the wall still successfully maitains the work's intensity.,images/works/51.jpg,audio/en/51_en.mp3,https://objecthub.keio.ac.jp/object/6022
48,INOKUMA Genichirō,Democracy,1949,"A piece out of the series <i>Symphonic Poem of Architecture</i> by TANIGUCHI Yoshiro， this mural was painted on the East and West Walls of the school cafeteria， which location was then inside the Students' Hall. After the Hall's demolition in 1992， the mural was relocated in the school cafeteria in the West Building. Its original shape maintained，  so the piece's upper side does not match the cafeteria's outline. The older Students' Hall employs the motif ""Openness""， which TANIGUCHI had applied since he had designed the Elementary School; the concept could be seen by the width of windows， air vents， and apertures. This mural by INOKUMA further enhances this effect. In <i>Democracy</i>， young people surrounded by animals play instruments and sing; they are enjoying the post-war democratic freedom as the title suggests. Furthermore， the piece's unrestrained composition and bright colors not only increases the compatibility with the TANIGUCHI structure， but also adds illumination to the room itself.",images/works/48.png,audio/en/48_en.mp3,https://objecthub.keio.ac.jp/object/6180
99,NOGUCHI Isamu,Gakusei (Student),1951,Of the sculptures that NOGUCHI had placed in Noguchi Room's garden with hopes to harmonize them with the environment， <i>Gakusei (Student)</i> is the biggest. Consisting of steel frames，  this pieces reaches up to 4 meters. It is said to represent students turning the pages of their books. <i>Gakusei</i> was shown in the magazine <i>Geijutsu Shincho</i> as a pairing piece of fire tower. Considering the fact that Shiba Fire Station's fire tower could be seen from <i>Banraisha</i> (common room) at the time，  as well as his father's poem that mentions bells functioning as alarms for air raids and Hiroshima Bell Tower that is similar in shape， <i>Gakusei</i>’s shape is a representation of NOGUCHI's hopes for the peaceful future for the students. Along with <i>Wakai Hito</i> and <i>Mu</i>， Noguchi had placed three unique pieces in a single garden. This demonstrates the complexity and the possiblility that his works in the early 1950s had held. The garden sculptures in Noguchi Room serves as a turning point for his subsequent works.,images/works/99.jpg,audio/en/99_en.mp3,https://objecthub.keio.ac.jp/object/5928
75,NOGUCHI Isamu,Wakai Hito (Young Person),1950,While designing Nogchi Room， Isamu NOGUCHI planned out the entire space including not only the room， but also the garden. Three of his sculptures were included in this plan. <i>Wakai Hito (Young Person)</i>， the model of which was displayed at his exhibition in Japan in 1950， is one of them. <i>Wakai Hito</i> could be categorized as a slab sculpture piece， consisting of marble， steel  plates， and so on. Isamu NOGUCHI had started working on this sculpture with surrealistic and abstract expressions from 1944. While sharing the same theme as KIKUCHI Kazuo's <i>Youth</i>， <i>Wakai Hito</i>’s uniqueness lies in the way it captures the liveliness of University students through an abstract style; its rhythmically placed curves fully demonstrates their energy on top of the Mita Hill.,images/works/75.jpg,audio/en/75_en.mp3,https://objecthub.keio.ac.jp/object/5927
84,NOGUCHI Isamu,Mu (Nothingness),1950‒1951,"<i>Mu (Nothingness)</i> is also a piece of sculpture created by Isamu NOGUCHI for the garden. Its original form had already been completed in the 1950 exhibition， and was considered a stone lantern that he deemed essential for the garden. Utilizing surrealistic modeling style resembling <i>Wakai Hito</i>， <i>Mu</i>’s twirling tentacle represents NOGUCHI's concept; harmony of the sculpture and its surrounding environment. This sculpture was originally placed on the west side of the Noguchi Room， because it used to embrace the setting sun within its arc and then become a ""stone lantern"" as Noguchi once intended it to be. The piece which had been inspired from mirrors， an empty object with multiple sides depending on the perspective， is not a simple sphere; rather， its sides are slightly off-put， allowing the viewers to see various sides from different angles. Since the placement of <i>Mu</i> and Noguchi Room is now different from the original， NOGUCHI'S concept-the chain of the sculpture's and the environment's harmony- has been shattered.This predicament emphasizes the most essential topic in art: the relationship between the piece and its surroundings.",images/works/84.jpg,audio/en/84_en.mp3,https://objecthub.keio.ac.jp/object/5926
66,SHIBATA Kaseki,Bust of Yukichi Fukuzawa,1953,When visitors take photos at Mita Campus， this bust of Yukichi Fukuzawa is rarely left unattended. Although its pairing with the old Library is now a symbol of Keio University， it had originally been installed on the front yard of the former First Faculty Building in 1954. Comemorating the 120th birthday of Yukichi Fukuzawa， its placement had been chosen and its surroundings constructed with advice from TANIGUCHI Yoshiro. This only portrayal of Yukichi Fukuzawa had been installed at Mita Campus， which is the heart of the entire University， because less and less people knew him directly. The sculptor is SHIBATA Kaseki， a graduate of Keio Futsubu School. He had seen pictures and seeked consultation of the descendants of Fukuzawa， so this sculptures portrays Fukuzawa's image very well. After relocation along with the Laboratory's demolition， it had been installed beside the Old Library entrance， which houses Fukuzawa Research Center， set up during the 125th Anniversary of the University's establishment in 1983. The bust was later removed again in 2017 due to renovation work on the old library building， and is now installed in front of the <i>Mita Enzetsu-kan </i>(Public Speaking Hall).,images/works/66.jpg,audio/en/66_en.mp3,https://objecthub.keio.ac.jp/object/5917
78,KIKUCHI Kazuo,Youth,1948,"TANIGUCHI Yoshiro had erected a statue at the center of a garden in front of the Third School Building of the Mita Campus in 1949. The statue was <i>Youth</i> by KIKUCHI， which he had immediately fallen in love with at the 1948 <i>Shin-seisaku-ha</i>  autumn exhibition. TANIGUCHI hoped to create a new atmosphere at Mita Campus under the reconciliation of architectures， gardens， and sculptures.With the demolition of the older Third School Building during the course of Mita Campus maintenance， <i>Youth</i> had been moved; it now quietly stands next to the Faculty Research Building. His right hand on the chin and his left hand hanging， the staue faces slightly downwards with a melancholic expression. The model of this statue was a young man from Tohoku; although he wished to be a vocalist， he had hurt his throat during war and had no choice but to abandon his dreams. KIKUCHI remarked that he was ""mesmerized by this man， who was as if he had left himself behind in the hollowness of war"".",images/works/78.jpg,audio/en/78_en.mp3,https://objecthub.keio.ac.jp/object/5925
32,ASAKURA Fumio,Heiwa Kitaru (Coming of Peace),1952,"Standing in front of the <i>Jukukan-kyoku</i> (Keio Corporate Administration)， this piece was sculpted by ASAKURA Fumio,a leading figure of the Post-war Japanese Sculpture. The muscular yet supple bodice reveals the pinnacle of ASAKURA's style and its remarkability in nude expression. As the title <i>Coming of Peace</i> suggests， this sculpture is a memorial of University students sent to the warfront during the Student Mobilization， never to return again. A message by KOIZUMI Shinzo， who was School President at the time， is carved on the pedestal; <i>In the peaceful days on the hill</i>， I remember the lost. These words convey his deep feelings for the students that were sent out to the frontline， including his own son. Along with <i>Youth</i> by KIKUCHI Kazuo and Wadatsumi no koe (the Voices from the Sea) by HONGO Shin， the three masterpieces of Post-war Japanese figurative sculpture gather in Mita. The youthful figures created in the 1940s represent  memorials of the lost young lives and hopes for the new age.",images/works/32.jpg,audio/en/32_en.mp3,https://objecthub.keio.ac.jp/object/5923
